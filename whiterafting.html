        <p>I have two words for this experience: dangerous and exhilarating. Feeling the strong rush of the 
           Nile River against me would have my heart beating out of my chest. I most definitely wouldn't 
           love the raft tipping over, but it would still be quite hilarious actually. Finally, I would be 
           shocked and terrified to see thousands of bats flying over me.
